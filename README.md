<h2 align="left">Personal Statement:</h2>
 
Looking back at my time at NUS thus far, I had the pleasure of meeting a wide range of people, and enriched many areas of my life. Prior to university, my journey has been relatively uneventful, as I haven’t been one to stand out in academics. However, the opportunities that NUS has provided me have completely changed my life for the better. Seizing these prospects required lots of courage, but came with many invaluable life lessons for myself. I learnt to be more outspoken by channelling my internal thoughts into constructive feedback and opinions for others, and making a name for myself as a critical thinker. Additionally, I discovered the importance of perseverance and value of admitting fault. Staying resilient through hardships builds self-confidence and inspires others to stay strong; Acknowledging mistakes can be embarrassing, but it undoubtedly helps improve trust and transparency. It also sharpens our decision-making skills, since we are less likely to repeat such errors. Be it working individually or as a group, possessing these two qualities is crucial to maximise success and be a better person. In this increasingly competitive world, I believe that one must harness and pick up skills like these to be able to thrive and stay relevant. All in all, I am proud of my character development during my time at NUS, and I am certain that with my adaptability and reflective mindset, I will be able to reach greater heights and make the most out of my university experiences.


<h2 align="left">What is your motivation for wanting to go on SEP? Pick a word and elaborate.</h2>

As someone who has never experienced an overseas school trip, having the chance to go for exchange would mean the world to me. This opportunity lets me push past my comfort zone, experience new cultures, and acquire global perspectives of my industry. Spending time abroad also allows me to start afresh and embark on a journey of holistic self-learning. I’m able to deepen my understanding of myself, while accumulating memories that I can share about with my peers, educators and future employers.


<h2 align="left">Please share one reason on how you rank your first, second and third choice of SEP destination.</h2>

After extensive research, I chose these 3 universities, each boasting uniquely intriguing histories. The University of North Carolina particularly resonates with me due to its strong emphasis on accessible education, providing debt-free tuition for low-income students. This aligns with my strong belief of helping others, as I myself come from a modest background. The university’s focus on inclusivity and altruism is very heart-warming, and I would love to be part of such a charitable committee.


<h2 align="left">What do you view as the most important aspect of SEP?</h2>
Learning to navigate ambiguity by yourself in a foreign environment, is what’s most important to me. SEP pushes one to broaden their knowledge, immerse themselves in a new culture, and forge unique friendships. Experiencing such moments on your own fosters a sense of self-reliance, an essential quality for independently navigating future opportunities. Studying abroad will be a one-time opportunity for my own personal development at another school, as well as a chance to expand my worldview.


<h2 align="left">Describe one of your greatest strength and weakness.</h2>

My greatest strength lies in my ability to to self-reflect; Learning from past struggles equips me with valuable knowledge to better tackle future setbacks. I’m also able to embrace my imperfections, push the boundaries of my thinking, and become a better version of myself. On the other hand, my tendency to take a long time to adjust to new environments has been a challenge.  However, I’ve grown to realise that this lets me better take in the dynamics of my new surroundings and find my footing.


<h2 align="left">Going on SEP does carry a certain amount of uncertainty, especially when neither NUS nor our partner universities can guarantee that you can secure the modules that you want to read during exchange. Please comment.</h2>

I believe that in life, we should never expect things to go our way. How we adapt and overcome to different situations, is what makes us truly human. Facing uncertainty and adversity is not easy by any means, but I am determined to make big decisions by myself to optimise my experience and minimise hassle. After all, it’s the shortcomings and hardships which we overcome that turns us into who we are today. I’m certain that I can persevere through such turbulent times with my sense of judgement.
